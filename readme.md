## :memo: About this Project
```
a bit more information will come soon...
```

## :thought_balloon: Future ideas 
- [x] make it more beatiful
- [ ] maybe standalone with pure html, css, js
- [ ] possibly adding some fancy subtle animations 
- [ ] using as a "template" for upcoming portfolios maybe
- [ ] more features

## :hearts: Thanks to 

- [Laravel](https://laravel.com/)
